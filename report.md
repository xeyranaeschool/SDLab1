This lab tested my ability to work with Git and GitHub, manage branches, document my work through commit messages, and deploy a simple web page to GitHub Pages. I was required to create a repository, make multiple commits, manage branches, and deploy an HTML file according to the specifications that were provided in lab assignment brief. It was my first time working with Git/Github so it was a bit of a challenge to complete this lab.
